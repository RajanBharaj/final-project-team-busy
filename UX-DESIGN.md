# User Experience Design

This repository contains instructions and files for two assignments that together comprise the user experience design phase of a web app.

Replace the contents of this file with the completed assignments, as described in:

- [app map & wireframe instructions](instructions-0a-app-map-wireframes.md).
- [prototype instructions](instructions-0b-prototyping.md)

# App Prototype
[Link to the Clickable Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/NUrsgWWd7bYRWXnVhkWUUK/Add-Ext.-Calendar-Wireframe?node-id=44%3A78&scaling=scale-down&page-id=20%3A60&starting-point-node-id=44%3A78)

This is the clickable / tappable mobile prototype for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of our application. Through this prototype, we have connected the wireframes that we created in Figma for the pages of our application. The prototype enables users to get a better understanding of how the different pages of our app are interconnected, and how they're accessed from within one another. It also includes some overlays that appear when you try to add an event to the calendar, select a month etc. 

# App Map
